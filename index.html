        <h3> Big Reasons Big Cats Don't Belong in the <a href="https://www.ringling.com/" target="_blank">Barnum and Bailey Circus</a>: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Large tigers are transported long distances in very small cages.</li>
          <li> Cubs are separated from their mother's too early causing emotional distress.</li>
          <li> Social and physiological needs are denied as tigers are solitary creatures and made to live in unnatural groups.</li>
          <li> Tigers are trained using food deprivation and punishment. </li>
          <li> Tiger's are innately afraid of fire and are made to jump through burning hoops. </li>
          <li> Due to big cats in captivity, 126 captive cats and 23 humans have DIED in the last 25 years. </li>
